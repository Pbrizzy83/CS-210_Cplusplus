#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

I created an app allowing users to see how their investments will grow.

#What did you do particularly well?

The outcome of the project was organized well. The app functionality was simple and very user-friendly. I was able to achieve this by keeping my coding organized and concise, debugging my code as I went along with my work.

#Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I think having a side-by-side comparison display would enhance the work more. This would allow the user to see and compare the differences in their investments a lot easier rather than cycling through the program multiple times to get a comparison.

#Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I used a vast number of external resources online for examples on a form to help simplify my coding so it was easier to follow and read. Keeping the coding clear and concise without repeating what I'd already entered earlier in the code was a challenge. I reached out to peers and colleagues for a fresh set of eyes to go over my code to help me stay on path.

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think being able to understand, write, and edit files in different languages will be helpful. Seeing the similarities and differences between JAVA, Python, and C++ will be super helpful to be able to harness the advantages of each. 

#How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I ensured that I included adequate notations to help make the program easily readable. The classes were all separated with source and header files.
